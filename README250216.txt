NOTE: For small numbers of photons, it may well be that a significant number of photons transmit straight through. We do not see ANY scintillation until an electron is produced in the medium: this is what can stimulate the medium to produce scintillation photons. Hence, we're waiting for a photoelectric absorption before scintillation occurs. 

6 MeV is the maximum energy, 2 MeV is more realistic. Either way, that's above the energies that PEE dominates, but below the energies where PP dominates. Hence, you won't get realistic values unless you use > 1000 photons, or indeed more. 

You should be able to (using JA's emailed code and the user guide) produce a distribution of photon energies from your GPS, to match the Bremsstrahlung curve. This will be infinitely more realistic and produce much better results. 

Consider however whether this should be in 'master' or 'DeathStarII', based on the studies we're actually intending for 'DeathStarII'.  

You're also going to need to check that the construction matches the specifications given to Dave Chorlton: inner diameter is 40mm and thickness is 5mm! Currently the *radius* is set to 4-5cm or something.
